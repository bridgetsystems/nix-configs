# nix-configs

beginner (i'd say) level nix-os configs, probably the most interesting thing i have is a flake and my nixpkgs overlay to NUR (i use Nix btw :nyaboomzoom:)

special thanks to [getchoo](https://github.com/getchoo/) for helping me out with various things and making me actually clean my config and place it here

### trans rights?
